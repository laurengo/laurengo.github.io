				<p>Andrew Tolan, a young professional in New York City, originally hails from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Since the time he could write sentences on loose paper and staple them together, Andrew has always found himself immersed in the concept of stories and fiction — finding passion in creating characters and the unique worlds they live in.

His debut novel, Hollow Planet, is the first book in the series. Later installments are currently in development.</p>
