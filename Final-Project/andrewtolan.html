                            <p>Andrew Tolan, a young professional in New York City, originally hails from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Since the time he could write sentences on loose paper and staple them together, Andrew has always found himself immersed in the concept of stories and fiction -- finding passion in creating characters and the unique worlds they live in. After years of cultivating ideas, notes, and creative musings, Andrew decided to compile his writings and set forth on shaping them into full-length works.</p>

                                    <p>After the death of his beloved father, Daniel’s life has never exactly become that of a typical teenager. He essentially home schooled himself and maintains a full time job at the local store. Additionally, he is forced to raise his younger sister since his mother made her social life a crutch to dealing with the loss of her husband. Daniel would love nothing more than to have a normal teen-age life — and to have his dad back. However, Daniel's despondent life would now become quite peculiar the day he meets a link to his father: a man by the name of Sef. Sef explains to Daniel the truth behind this world. He warns that Earth is in a downward spiral with an unfavorable ending. Daniel learns he can help save the planet from an impending danger, but only if he picks up where his father left off. Although what he is told all sounds crazy, Daniel realizes this strange encounter is the first time he has felt a rush, felt alive, felt anything at all. It’s a feeling he doesn't want to let go of. This moment would be the catalyst to Daniel’s life-altering adventure. A journey that will show him a whole other world that society has been ignorant of for years, inherent powers that were always present but never realized, a secret endeavor kept hidden from him by his own father, and an opportunity to save Earth from its imminent downfall. Still, none of this will come to Daniel without some heavy opposition from a small group looking to stop Sef and make Earth’s demise a reality.</p>

                                <p>&quot;I really enjoyed the story. Some areas were really interesting thinking if anything like that could be possible. There are a lot of areas in our world that have not been explored yet and wouldn't it be something if an area that is talked about in the book could be possible.&quot;</p><div class="right"><p>- Angie</p></div>

                                <p>&quot;Daniel's story takes you on a captivating journey between fantasy and reality. At first you believe the story is a coming of age book filled with teenage angst until Daniel finds a side of himself that he didn't know he possessed. Cannot wait for the next book!&quot;</p><div class="right"><p>- LG </p></div>
